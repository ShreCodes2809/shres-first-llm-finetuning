Structuring the implementation phase into Agile Sprints (time-bound periods of work, generally one (1) or two (2) weeks) gives customer stakeholders at all levels the opportunity to provide timely feedback, design  input and updates on task prioritisation. Palantir then uses this information to inform Sprint planning, allowing them to quickly address changes in requirements with minimal disruption to the project schedule.\nUnlike the Waterfall methodology, which can be linear or difficult to alter when project circumstances shift, Agile project plans are designed to incorporate the unexpected without disrupting the delivery of higher-level capabilities. In this way, an Agile approach will be better placed to build upon customer feedback on newly delivered capabilities, as well as to conduct any future unforeseen configuration work that may be required beyond the initial goals of this project. Further discussion and detail on Palantir's Agile methodology can be provided upon request. In what ways does Palantir's Agile methodology facilitate the incorporation of customer feedback?",
        "answer": "Palantir's Agile methodology facilitates the incorporation of customer feedback by providing a framework for continuous updates and adjustments during Sprints, allowing for rapid adaptation to new requirements based on stakeholder input."
